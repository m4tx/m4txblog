**Today I publish new appâ€”its name is Duplicate Lines Finder 2.0.**

It's 2.0, because previous versions was available only in Polish, so I didn't publish them on English m4txblog. This is the first version in English. ðŸ˜„ It's small application written in Java, which looks for duplicated lines or strings in text file and removes it, leaving only one occurrence of this string. Duplicate Lines Finder is very simple app, but I hope you will enjoy it. Here's the download Link for it:

Yours, m4tx ðŸ˜„
